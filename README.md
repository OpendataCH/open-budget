## Engineer: How to use
### Prerequisites
* ruby 1.9.3

* recommended params: `curl -#L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --autolibs=3 --ruby=1.9.3`
* make sure to load rvm into your shell sessions: [RVM is not found...](https://rvm.io/support/faq/)

### No JS runtime installed?
* `bundle config --local without js`
* or use `therubyracer` but I haven't had time to test it

### Start the server
* `bundle install` (needs to run every time the Gemfile changes)
* `rails s thin`
